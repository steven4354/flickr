Flickr Photo Search App

See the deployed app at: https://flickr-coding-test-id.herokuapp.com/

The master branch contains the original tag search feature, while the newfeature branch contains both tag and user id search.

To search by tags - just enter the tag term and hit 'Search by tag' and the images with that tag will populate the screen

To search by user - enter the user id and hit 'Search by id' and the photos from that user's public photostream on flickr will come up (Note only public user ids are currently supported ex. ids such as 92081980@N05 rather than personal ids like stevenli)

To search for a user's id you can use a application such as: https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/idgettr/
